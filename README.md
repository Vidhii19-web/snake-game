A classic Snake Game developed using C++ and the Raylib graphics library.
The project demonstrates real-time game logic, keyboard input handling, collision detection, and multimedia integration (graphics & sound).
This project recreates the traditional Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.
It focuses on game loop design, object movement, and event-based programming using Raylib.
Technologies Used:

Language: C++

Graphics Library: Raylib

Audio: Raylib Sound Module

Development Environment: Windows (MinGW / Visual Studio)
